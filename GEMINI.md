# Gemini Code Assistant Project Analysis

## Project Overview

*   **Name:** Minimalistic Todo App
*   **Description:** A simple to-do list application built with Flutter.
*   **Platform:** Primarily Android, with some web configuration.
*   **UI:** Clean and simple, using Material Design. It features a main screen with a task list, a date selector, and a floating action button to add new tasks.

## Current State Analysis (from `lib` directory)

### Core Functionality:

*   **Todo Management:** The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) to-do items.
*   **Persistence:** To-do items are stored locally in an SQLite database named `todo_list.db`. The database table `todos` has columns for `id`, `task`, `completed`, `deadline`, `created`, `updated`, and `completed_at`.
*   **State Management:** The app uses `StatefulWidget` and `setState` for managing the state of the main to-do list screen. The `_todos` list in `_TodoListScreenState` holds the current list of to-do items displayed on the screen.
*   **Date Selection:** The app features two ways to select a date:
    1.  A custom `DaySelector` widget that displays a 5-day view and allows navigation between weeks.
    2.  An `EasyInfiniteDateTimeLine` widget that provides a horizontal, scrollable timeline of dates.

### Code Structure and Components:

*   **`lib/main.dart`:** This is the main entry point of the application. It contains the `MyApp` widget, the `TodoListScreen` widget (which is the main screen), the `Todo` data model, and the logic for interacting with the database.
*   **`lib/components/dayselector.dart`:** This file contains a custom `DaySelector` widget, which is a stateful widget that allows the user to select a day. It is not currently being used in `main.dart`.
*   **`lib/generated/assets.dart`:** This file is empty, but it is likely intended to be used for auto-generating asset paths.

### State of the App:

The app appears to be in a functional state, with the core features of a to-do list application implemented. However, there are a few things to note:

*   **Unused Component:** The `DaySelector` widget is defined but not currently used in the main application. The `EasyInfiniteDateTimeLine` is used instead.
*   **Reminder Feature:** There is a "Reminder" checkbox in the "Add Todo" dialog, but it is currently hidden (`Visibility(visible: false, ...)`). The logic for handling reminders is partially implemented but not exposed to the user.
*   **Database Schema:** The database schema includes a `completed_at` column, but it is not currently being set when a task is marked as complete.
*   **Hardcoded Values:** The `_loadTodos` method currently loads to-do's within a hardcoded range of 2 days before and 3 days after the `activeDate`.

### Key Dependencies:

*   `flutter`: The core framework.
*   `sqflite`: For local database storage.
*   `google_fonts`: For custom fonts.
*   `intl`: For date formatting.
*   `easy_date_timeline`: For the date selection UI.
*   `date_field`: For date input in the "add todo" dialog.
